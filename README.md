# ATUS_2020
This project analyzes the American Time Use Surveys (2003-2020). 

Download and extract data available at: https://www.bls.gov/tus/data.htm

The current ATUS-CPS 2003-2020 file is not downloading, so the repository currently uses the 2003-2019 Multi-Year files and merges them with the 2020 Single-Year ATUS Microdata Files.
